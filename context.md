## Project Context for Cursor AI

This project is the official website for **T&H WebWorks**, a Des Moines-based tech company run by Sam and Devin.

### Our Two Main Services:
1. **Website Development (B2B)**  
   - Target: Small businesses, local brands  
   - Needs: A questionnaire intake form that asks how many pages, business type, logo upload, content, color schemes, etc.

2. **Mobile Tech Support (General Public)**  
   - Target: Non-tech-savvy users, seniors, remote workers, etc.  
   - Services: Printer help, Wi-Fi fixes, PC tune-ups, virus removal  
   - Needs: A booking form for in-home visits, with basic contact + problem description

### Goals:
- Easy conversion from visitor â†’ lead
- Call-to-action buttons for both service types
- Clean, simple UI that works on desktop and mobile
- Built to host on GitHub Pages

### Technical Stack:
- Static HTML/CSS/JS
- No backend (yet), so use hosted forms like Google Forms or Tally


## Logo Color Info for Branding

Primary Colors (from logo):
- Deep Blue: #051642
- Orange: #f45928
- White: #FFFFFF

Please update the color scheme in `style.css` so it matches these logo colors:
- Use Deep Blue for background or header
- Use Orange for buttons and highlights
- Use White or Light Gray for text and contrast

Optional:
- Add the logo to the top-left of the navbar
- Adjust padding and font size so it looks balanced with the logo
